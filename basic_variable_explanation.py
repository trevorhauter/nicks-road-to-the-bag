# VARIABLE TYPES

# String, can be anything, letters, numbers, symbols, etc.
example_string = "This is a string"

# Integer, this is a number WITHOUT a decimal
example_integer = 10

# Float, this is a number WITH decimals
example_float = 10.5


# List (commonly referred to as an array)
# This is a LIST of values, which can be any type of variable
# You can tell it's a list because of the brackets
# every value in the list must also be separated by commas
example_list = [
    example_string,
    example_integer,
    example_float,
    "another string value",
    100,
    100.5
]

# This is the exact same as the example_list above, it's just formatted differently for our eyes. Both are correct in
# this case
example_list = [example_string, example_integer, example_float, "another string value", 100, 100.5]


# Dictionary, think of this like a key: value pair. For example, you have a key such as "address", and the value
# corresponding to that key, will be the address itself. A dictionary will be inside curly braces (not brackets)
# When creating a key, you want to follow that with a colon, and the value will be on the other side obviously, and then
# to have multiple key/pairs, you separate those with commas

# Also, its important to note, the keys can be numbers, or strings, and the values can be ANYTHING
example_dictionary = {
    "address": "1234 Lucky Lane",
    "bedrooms": 4,
    "bathrooms": 2
}

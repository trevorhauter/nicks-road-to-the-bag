# This goes over how to access the values in strings/lists

# Functions used in this file (these are built in in python)
# len() This will get you the length of a list, or a string
# type() This will tell you what type of variable it is

example_string = "12345"
example_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# These will output the same value, because strings and lists are similar in the sense that you can loop through the
# values contained in the variable. You can also choose specific values, depending on the position or index of said variable
# In order to access a specific value, you can type the variable, followed by brackets, and inside the brackets you select
# the index of the value you would like to access. It starts at 0, so the first value, will be in the 0th position
print(example_string[0])
print(example_list[0])
